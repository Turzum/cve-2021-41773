# Apache 2.4.49 - Path Traversal or Remote Code Execution
cve-2021-41773.py is a python script that will help in finding Path Traversal or Remote Code Execution vulnerability in [Apache 2.4.49](https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.49.tar.gz). Intensionally vulnerable instance of Docker is provided to get your hands dirty on [CVE-2021-41773](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41773)

If CGI-BIN is enabled than, we can perform Remote Code Execution but not Path Traversal, so "icons" directory has been added under Alias section in httpd.conf for checking Path Traversal vulnerability.

# Vulnerable Configurations in httpd.conf
```
1. Enable CGI-BIN
2. Add "icons" directory in Alias section
3. <Directory>Require all granted</Directory>
```
